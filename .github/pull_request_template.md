\## SDLC Guardrails (Required)



\### üîí Secrets \& Config

\- \[ ] No secrets committed (tokens, passwords, conn strings, license files).

\- \[ ] All dynamic values read from DB or env (no hard-coded env-specific literals).

\- \[ ] If added: new \*\*NON-SECRET\*\* keys live in `dbo.AppConfig` (+ seeds per env).



\### üóÑÔ∏è Database Rules

\- \[ ] Only \*\*add-only\*\* migrations (no destructive alters/drops).

\- \[ ] All data access is \*\*SP-only\*\* (no ad-hoc SQL in code).

\- \[ ] New/updated SPs are idempotent (`CREATE OR ALTER`) and documented.

\- \[ ] `sp\_Lookup\_Get`, `sp\_Config\_\*`, `sp\_Security\_GetAllowedOrigins` contracts preserved.



\### üß© API Rules

\- \[ ] No hard-coded origins/IDs; authority/audience/scope come from DB.

\- \[ ] JWT enforced where required (scope policy), SSE auth toggle respected.

\- \[ ] CORS allow-list is DB-driven; \*\*no\*\* static CORS lists in code.



\### üé® UI/Theming Rules

\- \[ ] \*\*ThemeBuilder\*\* package is the single theming source (`mcpx-kendobridge`).

\- \[ ] No direct `@progress/kendo-theme-\*/dist/\*` imports under `web/src`.

\- \[ ] Import exists: `mcpx-kendobridge/dist/scss/index.scss`.



\### üß™ Tests \& Evidence

\- \[ ] Unit tests updated/added where meaningful (API providers, helpers).

\- \[ ] All CI jobs pass locally (or in Actions) including theme-guard.

\## Risk \& Rollout

\*\*Risk level:\*\* Low / Medium / High

\*\*Dependencies:\*\* (list services/keys/migrations that must exist)
